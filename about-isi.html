          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <h4 style="text-align: justify; font-weight:normal; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 150%;">Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) is a public research university which is recognized as institute of national importance in 1959 act of the Indian parliament. It grew out of the Statistical Laboratory set up by Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis in Presidency College, Kolkata.  Established in 1931, this university of India is one of the oldest and  most prestigious institutions focused on statistics, and its early  reputation led it to being adopted as a model for the first US institute  of Statistics set up at the Research Triangle, North Carolina by Gertrude Mary Cox.</h4>

          <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
          <h4 style="text-align: justify; font-weight:normal; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 150%;">The major objectives of the ISI are to facilitate research and training of Statistics, to indulge in  development of statistical theory and in application of statistical  techniques – in the scenarios of planning at national level and in  theoretical development of natural and social sciences, to participate  in the process of data collection and analysis, to operate related  projects in planning and improvement of efficiency of management and  production. <br>The Sanskrit phrase भिन्नेष्वैक्यस्य दर्शणम् (Bhinneswaykyasya  Darshanam), which literally means the philosophy of unity in diversity,  is incorporated in the logo of the institute, and is the motto of ISI.</h4>

          <h2>ACADEMICS</h2>
          <h4 style="text-align: justify; font-weight:normal; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 150%;">Traditionally, ISI offers fewer programs (and admits fewer students)  than most other degree granting academic institutions. Following the  empowerment for granting degrees in the subject of Statistics as per the  ISI Act 1959, in 1960, ISI initiated bachelor level degree program  Bachelor of Statistics and master level degree course Master of  Statistics, and also began awarding research level degrees such as PhD  and DSc. Later, ISI started offering Master of Technology (MTech) courses in  Computer Science and in Quality, Reliability & Operations Research  (QR&OR); these courses got recognition from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). As ISI Act of 1959 was amended by the Parliament of India in 1995, ISI  was empowered to confer degrees and diplomas in subjects such as  Mathematics, Quantitative Economics, Computer Science, and other  subjects related to Statistics and Operations Research as determined by  ISI from time to time. Apart from the degree courses, ISI offers few diploma and certificate  courses, special diploma courses for international students via ISEC,  and special courses in collaboration with CSO for training probationary officers of Indian Statistical Service (ISS).</h4>

ISI conducts the written tests at various examination centres across India. Only in few cases, candidates may get called for the interview  directly, viz. applicants of MTech Computer Science course having a GATE score above a threshold. Candidates applying to doctoral research programmes who have been  awarded (or qualified for) a Junior Research Fellowship by UGC / CSIR / NBHM etc are also required to clear the ISI admission test or an equivalent  separate test and interview conducted by the relevant JRF selection  committee of the institute if they wish to obtain a Ph.D from Indian  Statistical Institute.</h4>
